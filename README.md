# GuanZiZai
The name Guan Zi Zai comes from the Chinese Buddhaism Term.
It orginally means the observation of the representation of self-existence and the self-liberation and freedom gained after such observation.

I expand the context to the aestheticazation process to raise questions about the mechanism for aesthetic experience: 

How much subjectivity is involved in the aesthetic experience? 
Can objectivity leave some commonality after the subjective aestheticazation process?
Are the boundaries between subject and object in the aestheticazation process dissolving?
Is the aestheticization of external objects also a form of self observation?

By correlating the viewer's brain waves with the images generated in real time, the project creates a circular circuit that includes the human brain:the viewer's brain waves will affect the images on the screen in real time,and the images on the screen will affect the viewer's brain waves when they look at the screen.
